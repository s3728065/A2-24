              Motiana grew up in the pacific island of Western Samoa. Beautiful Polynesian country
              where family is the core of all values and traditions. Motiana migrated to New Zealand
              before eventually settling down in Australia. Motiana is bilingual and has undertaken
              various courses as part of her professional development in New Zealand and Australia. After
              having pursued a successful career in Disability services she is now aiming to go further by
              studying IT. Her interests in IT developed overtime as she saw the remarkable pace at which
              IT Technologies have grown and have had a positive impact on all facets of life. Through her
              work experience she also saw a need to have basic IT education which can complement any
              chosen career. Her IT experiences so far have been from user’s perspective, but she is
              aiming to expand her skills as she progresses in her IT degree and apply those to further her
              career. Motiana’s roadmap towards her career in IT includes Scrum Master certification and
              eventually a degree in IT.

              Jo was born in Australia to English parents who settled here in the 70s. Artistic in nature, Jo also
loves performance vehicles and owns a WRX. Her interest in IT stems from a strong desire to
understand how technology works. This began about 7 years ago when she started working on the
helpdesk of a software company. Jo came to enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of it and would often
test things in her downtime to fill gaps in her knowledge. She also really enjoyed writing technical
guides and documentation on how to perform certain processes, and found it quite rewarding to not
only solve problems for clients but teach them new or better ways of doing something using
technology. Her experience is somewhat limited in that work was more-so related to the software
itself rather than the computer or programs running on it, but by proxy she also learned a range of
skills such as the process of troubleshooting by elimination (which largely comes down to knowing
the right questions to ask), the software testing process, knowledge of client-server systems, and the
basic concepts of database maintenance and repair. Jo intends to obtain her ideal job by continuing
further studies in IT as well as seeking professional certifications in aeras of web development and
software testing.

              Mason is from North Queensland and has fond memories of playing video games on pcs and PS4.
This led to his fascination with IT technologies and their potential applications in tackling issues such
as coping with deteriorating weather patterns and unpredictable storm surges due to global
warming. Mason is passionate about building an application which integrates data available in public
domain such Bureau Of Meteorology and uses Raspberry Pi to create physical indicators which alert
users before they leave the premises, of possible stormy weather. Mason’s ideal job is to work as a
field technician and offer technical support. He intends to acquire the necessary technical skills by
pursuing a degree in IT at RMIT.

                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <h6>Topic</h6>
                <p>
                  The project is a production grade web application that will power a backend and a front end
involving both restaurateurs and patrons. The application will be linked to a restaurant
website, where customers can sit at the table and place orders and pay via their phone
without needing to order at the counter. Customers can scan QR codes or visit the main
website to place an order, once the order has been placed the order is then sent to the
restaurant’s dashboard which will be linked to the docket printer. This system’s backend will
also integrate to the restaurants’ POS(Point of Sale) system. When orders are ready and
passed out of the kitchen, the staff will have the ability to send a push/SMS notification to the
customers allowing them to collect the food from the serving area. The customer will also be
able to leave real time feedback about the quality of food and services received right on the
platform allowing business to strengthen their weakness. Since this platform is a web
application built with mobile first approach, the user experience will be very intuitive. This
project aims to provide exceptional service to both customers and the business by reducing
human errors that may otherwise occur in taking orders.

                <h6>Motivation</h6>

                <p>The motivation behind the project is to help the family business in the technological side. I
                  look for ideas to improve the shop and find ways to fix problems. Recently we have been
                  struggling at busy times with some customers taking too long to order. As customers take
                  longer the wait time increases for others and there are lines of customers while one staff is
                  busy just taking orders and not able to help others.</p>
                <p>There are apps out there, but all comes at a premium fee, and they lack certain features.
                There are also multiple online food delivery companies, but they all charge hefty fees which
                forces restaurants to increase food prices to be able to profit from their sales.</p> 
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-8">
                <h6>Landscape</h6>
                <p>Our contactless ordering application is part of an ecosystem which has thrived since COVID
                  pandemic. Contactless ordering is not a new concept and there are many products in the 
                  13
                  market which cater for this concept as illustrated below. Our product SmartOrder® has an
                  edge over its competitors because it offers a complete contactless experience by
                  incorporating and integrating bookings, tableside ordering, link to secure payments and a
                  chatbot which offers information about dishes which may contain food allergens as well as
                  caters for particular preferences such as Kosher and halal foods. The philosophy and
                  motivation behind the development of SmartOrder® is to offer contactless ordering from
                  social distancing perspective but also as a tool to reduce costs for hospitality industry.
                  SmartOrder® does not have subscription fee, it has no ongoing fee for business owners, it
                  charges a small transaction fee of 0.9% which is paid by the restaurant owner and not by
                  customers. </p>

              <div class="col-lg-8">
                <p>The project will be a web app linked to the restaurant's main website. Customers can place an order
                  for takeaway from anywhere through the web app but can only order dine-in if they are seated at a
                  table. Ordering from the app helps restaurants a great deal as it will reduce the amount of staff
                  needed to take orders instead, they can use that extra force in the kitchen, this will be especially
                  helpful in busy times. The reduced customer interaction means the restaurant can focus more on
                  the quality of food.
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a seat reservation function where customers must sign in to book a table, and the booked
                    table will be displayed as Reserved before a certain time from reserved time. When the table is
                    Reserved customers will not be able to place an order from that table unless the person that booked
                    orders from their account.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the app each table's QR code will be linked to a table in the POS System. Once a customer enters
                      the shop, they will take a seat at the table of their choosing. To view the menu customers will need
                      to scan the QR code at the table or visit the restaurant website then go to order.                      
                      </p>
                    <p>Ordering from the table, the customer has access to the full menu and what is being served, can
                      place each item to cart and to place the order they must pay. Once payment is received, the order is
                      then sent to the kitchen printer. Then after the order is ready the chef can send notification to
                      customers that placed the order via Admin App to let them know that their food is ready and they
                      should pick it up from the counter.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Review System - customers can give feedback and rating on their food once they are done, they can
choose to leave review as anonymous, this review will go directly to the restaurant which will help
them improve. This will help in keeping a good track record of satisfied customers which will work in
favour of the restaurant. This will ensure that the restaurant's food and service is always excellent
quality.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Loyalty System - customers can place orders as guests or register an account which will track how
many visits they have had and will be given loyal customer offers(could be monthly specials or
discounts after certain amount of orders etc.). Owners can set up loyalty offers via the admin panel,
they can run monthly offers or run offers based on orders where after customers have placed orders
a certain amount of times on different occasions they will receive a reward.

                      <h5>Aims</h5>
                      <p>
                        Mobile  phones  have  become  an  integral  part  of  our  daily  life.  With  seamless  internet  connectivity,  these  devices  have  become  a  utility  with  immense  possibility.  Among  several  applications  users  engage in their daily life, with this web application, we aim to provide a very comfortable, secure, and reliable way for people to experience dining in at a restaurant. Not only that, but this application will also allow restaurants to manage their menu online, collect orders and feedback from customers in real  time.  This  project  aims  to  provide  exceptional  service  to  both  customers  and  the  business  by  reducing human errors that may otherwise occur in taking orders.

From business owner’s  perspective,  provide  a  sustainable  environment  which  meets  the  stringent  regulatory  requirements but also delivers cost saving measures in the wake of declining demand. But due to time and  financial  constraints,  we  had  to  define  the  scope  and  limitations  of  our  product.  The  rollout  is  going  to  be  in  stages  and  there  will  be  eventual  upgrades,  first  version  of  our  application  will  have  defined limitations in key areas such as.

                        Cybersecurity –  Our  application  uses  third  party  service  providers  such  as  web  hosting  and  cloud-based  data  storage.  Third  parties  are  responsible  for  the  integrity  of  information  stored  on  their servers, but it can certainly be enhanced by deploying additional cybersecurity measures.

                      <p>
                        SmartOrder® also provides a link to restaurant payment system, this has potential for infiltration, but team has decided that at this stage no additional cybersecurity is warranted. Product integrity will be monitored, and any breaches will be scrutinised, additional cybersecurity measures will be integrated into our systems should there be a need for it in future.

                        Chatbot – What a chatbot can do is only limited by the imagination of the project team deploying it. At the beginning of our project, team 24 envisaged a chatbot with inbuilt capabilities to answer not only basic customer enquiries but also offer them advice on dishes containing food allergens and help customers  with  specific  preferences  such  as  halal,  kosher  and  vegan  meals.  In  the  end,  due  to  time  constraints team decided to opt for a third-party bot with minimal capability but one which will answer simple queries and direct customers to service desk if required.

                      <h5>Tools and Technologies</h5>
                      <p>The hardware requirements to use the web app are:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Customers  will  require  smart  phones  with  internet  connection  to  go  on  to  the  website  and  make orders, track orders.</li>
                        <li>Client will require: iPad/POS System, WIFI printer, requires internet connection on premisesto access their admin panel, receive orders, manage orders & print order.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        Since the project is a large-scale application, to divide the workload of the application amongst all the team  members  evenly,  we  decided  to  break  down  the  whole  application  stack  into  multiple  manageable modules. Each team member will be given a module to work on and research with regards to jobs they are interested in. The modules will be broken down into the following:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>UI and UX design and development module</li>
                        <li>Customer sign in and sign out module - Designing and developing sign in and sign out system</li>
                        <li>Restaurant menu holding module - Database of restaurant menu</li>
                        <li>Ordering module - Design and developing of an ordering system which will have cart function, payment gateway, and send orders to the restaurant</li>
                        <li>Admin  panel  -  Basic  admin  panel  to  override  all  the  modules  if  needed,  and  will  have  management features for staff, so that staff at the shop can change easily, will have features such as putting items off the menu for the day, adding specials, changing prices, editing menu, add photos etc.</li>
                        <li>Admin  panel  -  Basic  admin  panel  to  override  all  the  modules  if  needed,  and  will  have  management features for staff, so that staff at the shop can change easily, will have features such as putting items off the menu for the day, adding specials, changing prices, editing menu, add photos etc.</li>
                        <li>Branding module - promoting and marketing the app to the end users, so shops can receive orders online, this module will also include deployment of the application.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        We will look at each members ideal job and will assign tasks accordingly, we all have different interests which will link up well with the modules, Amer will handle the project management, Roshan and Simon will handle the development of Software, Joanna will handle the testing and Mason will assist Joanna on application testing and also handle support after the deployment of project.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Github will be used for group collaboration, as it is a great platform and packed with features, it has seamless collaboration and version control. Trello is a great way to assign tasks and set a due date for tasks to each member of the group, it can also be used for progress tracking through comments.To use the service, the customers will need a smartphone that can access the internet. The shop will need a Wi-Fi printer, POS System, and a device that can access the web application admin panel for order management.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For technical skills, knowledge and ideas on different programming languages is required. Knowledge of  visual  language  such  as  HTML,  CSS,  JavaScript  is  needed  for  front  end  development  and  to  learn  other helpful languages like NodeJS. To make the app work and connect to the server it will require knowledge of server sided languages such as Php, Ruby, Python etc. For databases, we will be using MongoDB because of its flexibility and ease of use, MongoDB will not require extensive knowledge like MySQL. We are planning to use NodeJS as a back-end for the application as this provides flexibility of  using  JavaScript  on  both  front  and  back  end.  Angular  and  React  for  front-end. We are looking at researching these functionalities for ease of use.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For  Application  hosting,  we  will  research  on  Netlify  as  they  provide  a  free  tier  for  hosting,  easy  deployment  of  the  project,  as  you  can  just  Git  push  to  deploy  worldwide,  this  can  link  up  well  with  GitHub. As Application hosting is a downside of our group because we do not have knowledge on this, so this will provide simplified hosting.

                      <h5>Stack Choice</h5>
                      <h6>MEAN Stack</h6>
                      <p>For development method, we will be following the MEAN stack, it is an agile development method, that consist of JavaScript based technology to produce web apps.</p>
                      <p>MEAN Stack stands for:</p>
                      <img src="img/MEAN.JPG" alt="">
                      <p>
                        MEAN stack is collection of JavaScript technologies used to develop web applications. From client to server  and  server  to  database,  everything  is  based  on  JavaScript.  MEAN  stack  is  used  to  build  quick  and robust web applications.
                      </p>
                      <h6>Why MEAN stack?</h6>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1 language handles everything from frontend to backend</li>
                        <li>Flexible Backend API – Flexible and reusable API which can be used for web apps or application</li>
                        <li>Powerful Frontend – mobile app like experience, updates instantly, great user experience</li>
                        <li>Separation of Concerns – separate frontend and backend, makes it easier to work in a team.</li>

                      <p>MongoDB is a free and open source database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database; it has no fixed schema which means that you can create records without first defining the structure. Unlike MySQL. Data is stored in JSON or BSON format unlike MySQL where data is stored in a tabular format. Adding new data to MongoDB is simpler as it does not require updating the whole table. With MongoDB you can develop an entire application using only JavaScript.</p>
                      <h6>NoSQL Database Model</h6>
                      <p>NoSQL is non-relational database; they do not use tables or columns. A flexible database used for big data  and  real-time  web  applications.  NoSQL  handles  unstructured  data  where  data  doesn’t  have  to  
                        20relate and you don’t have to predefine data compared to relational data, it is cheaper to manage, and scales better, as the database gets bigger you can just add more nodes compared to upgrading a whole data infrastructure. NoSQL does not have steep learning curve.</p>
                        <h5>Express</h5>
                        <h6>What is Express.js</h6>

                        <p>
                          With Angular we can create elements that is constantly used into a component, which makes it so we don’t have to keep coding the same thing over and over again, Angular can be used to create headers, footers, special banner etc.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Angular also features Terminal, where you can components easily, it auto generates all files required to create a new component. Angular Bootstrap to be used to create the front-end UI/UX elements.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Angular Bootstrap Module</h5>
                        <p>
                          Bootstrap will used to create the User Interface; bootstrap is a front-end framework that can be used to create responsive websites and web apps. It is free to use but packed with HTML and CSS templates and features to make creating user interface easy. It simplifies the project, saving time when creating user  interface.  Bootstrap  contains  documentation  of  all  the  features,  making  it  easy  to  create  the  front-end of the website by simply following the documentation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Bootstrap  can  be  used  without  any  experience  in  it  as  everything  is  readily  available  –  although experience in HTML and CSS is highly recommended to make changes that is desired to fit the style on the company. We can use Bootstrap to create all the user interfaces in the web app this includes:
                        </p>
                        <p>For Customers:</p>

                        <p>
                          This can all be created using Bootstrap, we can follow the documentations to create each of the  following.  As  bootstrap  is  a  library  of  features  it  will  have  prebuilt  forms  which  can  be  used  to  create  sign  in/sign  up  page  for  both  admins  and  customers.  In  the  documentation,  the navigation bar, image gallery, tables are all included to create all other pages.

                        <h5>NodeJS</h5>
                        <h6>What is NodeJS</h6>
                        <p>NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime, instead of JavaScript running on browser environment, it runs on your machine  as  a  service  or  a  runtime,  which  allows  use  JavaScript  as  a  server  sided  language  like  Php,  python etc., essentially allows us to run JavaScript to code on the server. NodeJS requires knowledge of JavaScript Fundamentals. </p>
                        <h6>Why use NodeJS?</h6>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Fast, efficient, and highly scalable</li>

                          <li>Popular in the industry</li>
                          <li>Same language on front-end and back-end uses JavaScript</li>
                          <li>Great for real time services such as chat, shopping carts etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Web Hosting</h5>
                        <p>
                          The deployment and hosting of the web site for our application will be handled by Heroku. Heroku is a  cloud-based  application  hosting  service  which  allows  developers  to  run  their  application  across  a  pre-set number of virtual servers known as “Dynos”. Dynos are Heroku’s version of containerisation, which is a type of software virtualisation system that allows multiple applications to share the same physical hardware(Rouse, 2014).  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Heroku offers an efficient and complete hosting service which is cost-effective and dynamic. Some of the features their service includes are, the management of releases by rolling out your application to different  environments,  ensuring  your  application automatically  recovers from server  failures,  and  handling load  balancing across  many  application  instances,  allowing  you  to  instantly  scale  your  application(What is Heroku | Heroku, 2020). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Heroku  supports  all  the  most  common  application  programming  languages  such  as Ruby,  Node.js,  Python,  Java,  Go,  PHP, and Scala.  Deployment  through  GitHub  is  also  available.  This  provides  easy  deployment of existing applications on Heroku with minimum modifications needed(What is Heroku | Heroku, 2020). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Heroku offers several different service packages, the first three would be of interest to our application. They are:  
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>“Free/Hobby” A service for small scale applications, personal projects, and testing.</li>
                          <li>“Production” For larger scale business-focused applications that require greater bandwidth and support.</li>
                          <li>“Advanced” For mission-critical business web applications that require high availability and can handle a high volume of traffic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          Within  each  of  these  packages  we  can  choose  different  levels  services  such  as  RAM,  storage,  and connections. Initial development and testing of our web application would be implemented with the “Hobby” package. This provides basic application hosting and includes 512MB of RAM which would be sufficient to allow us to test and develop the application before full deployment.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Once our web app is fully deployed, we would need to initially upgrade to the “Production” package which starts at US$25 per month. This package offers an increased access bandwidth and many other additional included features. The amount of RAM assigned to your app is variable but obviously has a greater cost when more RAM is used. This package would be sufficient for most of our usage. It would only be when we reached a high level of customer requests that we would need to move to the next package. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          With this in mind, Heroku’s service is scalable, which means that we can easily increase or decrease the level of service that we require. This will make it necessary for us to regularly monitor our applications level of usage and determine if changes to our package are required. The “Advanced” package is a lot more expensive, starting at US$250 a month, but it would always be necessary to upgrade to the higher service  when  demand  increases  because  slow  application  response  times  will  negatively  impact  the  customers experience(Pricing | Heroku, 2020).

                        <h5>Back-end Database Handling</h5>
                        <p>
                          The back-end database for our application will be handled by MongoDB. MongoDB is an open-source database developed by MongoDB, Inc. It is a non-SQL database language that stores data in JSON and BSON type documents that can vary in structure. Related information is stored together for fast query access  through  the  MongoDB  query  language.  MongoDB  uses  dynamic  schemas,  meaning  that  you  can create records without first defining the structure. The structure of documents can be changed simply  by  adding  new  fields  or  deleting  existing  ones  and  documents  in  a  collection do not need to have  an  identical  set  of  fields.  This  data  model  provides  the  ability  to  represent  hierarchical  relationships  and  complex  structures  easily.  MongoDB  is  also  designed  with  high  availability  and  scalability, which allows for a flexible database system and future increases in usage(The most popular database for modern apps, 2020).   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The most efficient and cost-effective way to implement database management for our application will be as a cloud service. This will reduce our need to manage and service our own infrastructure (servers, network connections, etc.). To access MongoDB’s cloud service, which is known as MongoDB Atlas, the  company  charge  a  monthly  fee  depending  on  the  level  of  service  we  require.  There  are  three  different packages available: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>“Shared” for testing and small-scale implementation.</li>
                          <li>“Dedicated” for medium and large-scale implementations.</li>
                          <li>“Dedicated  Multi-Region”  for  large  scale  implementations  across  multiple  world  regions  (countries). </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          For development, testing and initial implementation of our application the minimum service we would need is the “Shared” package which includes shared CPU and RAM processing. With 5GB of storage the  monthly  fee  is  US$25.  However,  once  the  application  is  fully  operational  and  is  in  use  across  multiple  sites  database  management  would  need  to  be  scaled  up  to  cope  with  increased  usage.  Toaccess additional services, we would need to have the “Dedicated” package which includes dedicated CPU  and  RAM  processing  and  a  minimum  of  10GB  of  storage  for  US$57  a  month.  However,  fees  increase depending on the speed of processing and amount of storage required. Ongoing monitoring and  consultation  with  MongoDB  staff  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  the  correct  level  of  service  is  maintained(Pricing, 2020).

                        <h5>Natural Language Processing and Chatbots</h5>
                        <p>
                          Chatbots are software programs designed to interact with humans in lieu of interactions with other humans. They are mostly used by companies to supplement online customer service capabilities and direct  people  to  dedicated  customer  service  agents,  and  as  assistance  apps  on  mobile  phones  and  computers (e.g. Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant). Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the name used for software processes which are designed to interpret human communication. Different chatbots will use different types of NLP depending on the environment they are implemented in and the level of technology  available  to  the  organisation  which  created  the  chatbot.  (En.wikipedia.org. Natural Language Processing. 2020.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Because chatbots rely on NLP to communicate with humans, the development of both has gone hand in hand. The first chatbot developed was call ELIZA and was developed primarily to evaluate the Turing Test. This test devised by Alan Turing was to assess a machines intelligence from a person’s ability to determine if they are communicating with another person or a machine. The NLP used in these early model chatbots was basically a database of phrases that were manually matched up to the input from the human. (En.wikipedia.org. Turing Test. 2020.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Since then there have been two major shifts in NLP implementation. The first of these began early in the 1990’s when the increase in computational power made it possible for algorithms to be written which  allowed  software  to  “learn”  by  studying  written  text.  The  algorithms  then  used  statistical  models to infer further information about the language that they were processing and to formulate responses  base  on  probabilities.  This  is  called  Statistical  NLP.  (En.wikipedia.org. Natural  Language  Processing. 2020.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Skipping forward to current technology, NLP has progressed to understanding human speech, which is much harder for a computer to do than understanding written text. Peoples speech is very variable, for instance not only are there many different languages spoken, people speak different dialects and with different accents. Speech is also not as structured as text as people can mumble, slur, use slang and can use terms from other languages. (Sas.com. What Is Natural Language Processing?. 2020.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This progress has been made possible by the second shift in NLP implementation, which has also been made possible because of the further increase in computation power. This latest implementation is termed  as  Neural  NLP  and  is  a  subset  of  Artificial  Intelligence  research.  Neural  NLP  uses  Artificial  Neural  Networks  (ANN)  to  “learn”  in  a  more  efficient  way.  ANN’s  are,  simply  put,  a  collection  of  computational  segments  designed  to  mimic  the  structure  of  animal  brains.  There  are  “neurons”  interconnected with “synapses” and the individual synapses are strengthened the more they are used (En.wikipedia.org. Artificial  Neural  Network.  2020.).  The  main  processes  the  ANN’s  use  to  learn  are  known  as  Deep  Learning  and  Data  Mining.  Deep  Learning  is  a  process  where  the  ANN’s  repeatedly  perform  set  tasks  on  different  sets  of  data  and  alter  their  responses  and  methods  according  to  the  results they receive. This technique has been made possible by the massive amount of data available with the current ubiquitous use of the internet (Marr, B., What Is Deep Learning AI? A Simple Guide With 8 Practical Examples. 2020.). Data Mining is the method of analysing large amounts of data using statistical  algorithms  to  extract  predictions  about  other  events  and  processes.  This  is  like  what  was  used with Statistical NLP, but with much larger amounts of data available and more efficient ANN’s to process it. (Sas.com.What Is Data Mining?. 2020)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Current chatbot technology is widely used in customer service situations. While they are very efficient at simple tasks, they are generally programmed to transfer the customer to a human agent when more complex situations arise. It is also generally made obvious to the customer by the companies that use the  chatbots  that  they  are  communicating  with  a  bot  (Chi,  C.,  7  Of  The  Best  AI  Chatbots  For  2020. 2020).  Although,  at  the  moment  there  is  a  rapid  increase  in  the  level  of  Artificial  Intelligence  being  implemented in public fields and Natural Language Processing is a part of this. It is quite feasible that in the near future all our phone and text interactions with companies will exclusively be with chatbots and we may not be able to tell the difference between them and a real person. Also, as technology becomes more complicated tech companies will need to find better user interfaces for their products and chatbots are the best option for this. If you can interact with your device the same way you would another person, it would be the easiest option for the user.

                        <h5>Testing</h5>
                        <p>
                          Testing throughout the developmental stages of a new app or program is crucial to ensuring that the app not only runs as intended, but that it is meeting and preferably exceeding the needs and wants of its target market.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The testing strategy for the SmartOrder® app will involve a combination of formal and informal testing methods  including  unit  testing,  integration  testing,  system  testing,  exploratory  testing  and  user  
feedback  testing.  Given  the  novelty  of  the  app  however,  greater  emphasis  will  be  placed  on exploratory and user feedback testing, as these are inherently the best methods for determining user friendliness and intuitiveness for users who have never used the app before. It is expected and hoped that improvements in features and functionality will be implemented as a result of feature requests and constructive criticism that arises throughout the testing process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          As our developers begin to create the product, testing of the absolute fundamentals will be performed in  a  process  called  unit  testing.  In  programming,  a  ‘unit’  is  the  smallest  testable  part  of  a  piece  of  software, and so unit testing is the act of running a block of code e.g a function, to ensure it works correctly (Unit  Testing  –  Software  Testing  Fundamentals,  2020).  Unit  testing  requires  programming  knowledge and is done usually at the time of writing the code, so the team’s developers Roshan and Simon will be responsible for performing this. Defects or bugs in the code will be corrected as they are found, negating any requirement for these to be formally documented or tracked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Once the units of code have been compiled, integration testing can be performed by the team’s test analyst  Joanna  and  support  analyst  Mason.  Integration  testing  involves  combining  the  individual  components (units) of the software and testing them as a group. This helps identify any faults which may only become apparent when the components are made to interact with one another (Integration Testing – Software Testing Fundamentals, 2020).  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the context of our app, integration testing will consist of testing combined components which have direct relationships; for example, submitting an order and processing the credit card payment.Once enough components of the app have been created that sequences of actions can be performed on a mocked up interface, some in-house system testing can occur. A checklist of items (Fig 1.) shall be used to ensure each component does get tested, and the same features will be tested at various intervals throughout the project’s lifetime to account for any inadvertent bugs that may appear due to changes elsewhere in the code. It’s at this point we can also draw upon the expertise of our industry based testers (Roshan’s family), to test the components and begin to provide feedback to the team in a collaborative fashion. Having this occur early on in the project is invaluable as industry experts will have  insight  on  a  multitude  of  variables  specific  to  the  restaurant  environment  and  likely  think  of  unique scenarios developers and testers simply could not. It is also far easier to make changes to the app earlier on and avoid the possibility of having to sacrifice many hours of work later on down the track when it’s discovered something needed to work differently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          When SmartOrder® has enough functionality for it to become a prototype, a broader range of testers will  be  sought  to  test  the  app  in  an  explorative  way.  Explorative  testing  allows  testers  to  have  free  reign of the app, and in no set order, explore and try whichever buttons and functions of the app they choose (Parmar, 2020). One of the key aims for the team is to create an app which any customer can easily understand and be able to use without assistance or prompts, and explorative testing is ideal in that it replicates this style of self learning behaviour.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Other factors relating to external variables will also need to be tested, including OS of the device that is being used, and performance of the system during heavy use periods (20+ concurrent users).
                        </p>
                        <p>Fig 1. Testing Checklist</p>
                        <img src="img/testing.JPG" alt="">
                        <p>
                          Our  test  users  will  preferably  need  to  be  a  diverse  group  of  people  who  represent  the  typical  patronage in a restaurant setting, as well as those who are experienced in various roles at restaurants, including  wait  staff,  kitchen  staff,  floor  managers  and  business  owners.  Roshan’s  inspiration  for  the  app drew from a desire to help his family’s own restaurant, and so staff from the restaurant will be called upon in the early stages of testing. One to two waitstaff, a cook, and the business owner shall be sufficient to begin with. As testing increases in the later stages of the app’s development, a pool of roughly 15-20 testers of various ages and levels of technological savviness would be ideal, particularly 
to help replicate scenarios of heavy load/traffic on the system. The app could be offered as a free trial in the restaurant one evening, and/or beta testers could be sought via a company such as Ubertesters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          While it can never be known if a program is entirely bug free, some valid markers to indicate successful test  phase  completion  would  be  an  app  which  has  had  all  known  bugs  corrected,  and  a  consensus  among the majority of users that the app would greatly benefit their business and workflow. 
                        </p>

                        <a href="https://smartorder24.herokuapp.com/">Link: https://smartorder24.herokuapp.com/</a>
                        <p>Team  24  development  team  has  been  able  to  create  a  working  prototype  of  the  project  idea.  Prototype is a visual presentation of most of the functions of our actual web application. It has login, register, add to cart, total amount, payment system features. It also uses cookies which are stored for a  period  of  24  hours  and  are  reset  if  transaction  is  completed  by  way  of  a  payment.  This  prototype  provides a template for the further development of our web application. It also provides opportunities for testing team to test the basic functionality of various components, look at the qualitative aspects such  as  design  features,  placement  of  tabs  and  information  on  the  webpage  and  provide  ideas  for  further improvement. </p>

                        <p>Additional Notes: Motiana’s role was changed from GitHub CLI collaboration for the development team to overseeing the documents and project artifacts. This change was made to cater for the change in her personal circumstances as well project team identifying the need for one person to review and suggest edits given the scale of this project. </p>
                        <p>
                          Development team decided to change webhosting from Netlify to Heroku in the later phase of the project. This change was deemed necessary because as project  evolved,  Netlify  could  no  longer  support  more  dynamic  features  of  our  application.  Plans  were  changed  and  tasks  were  reassigned  within  our development team.  
                        </p>
                        <h5>Risks</h5>
                        <p>
                          Team 24 has  identified  number  of  risk  factors  which  could  impact  our  IT  project  (Robertson,  2020). These include. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Inaccurate Estimation – Cost overruns and missed deadlines are the two most common risks in project monument. This usually occurs due to inexperienced project manager or in smaller team structures, unforeseen extenuating circumstances leads to missed deadlines.  
                        </p>
                        <p>Scope  Variation  –  Scope  variation  could  arise  from  changing  market  conditions,  what  looked  like  a  viable marketable product in the beginning may no longer be competitive due to the launch of other products. </p>
                        <p>End-user  Engagement  –  Extensive  engagement  with  the  stakeholders  is  required,  most  successful  projects are carried out from consumer perspective, failure to do so can be costly. </p>
                        <p>Stakeholder Expectations – A significant change in stakeholder expectations can derail a project. This can happen because either stakeholder’s  see alternative applications which seem more attractive or that they have unrealistic expectations which cannot be met within the defined project parameters, scope, and limitations.  </p>
                        <p>
                          Poor Quality Code – Coding errors can lead to poor functionality of the application and it can cause significant damage to the consumer confidence in the product. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Inadequate  Risk  Management  –  All  risk  factors  need  to  be  evaluated  in  the  planning  phase  of  the  project, ideally risk matrix should be included in project management and a risk mitigation strategy should be implemented. Failure to do this can have catastrophic impact on a project. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Inadequate  Human  Resources  –  Inadequate  human  resources  affect  small  teams  carrying  out  big  projects.  Underperformance  due  to  extenuating  circumstances  or  lack  of  motivation  can  add  significant  workload  to  other  team  members.  Additional  human  resources  cannot  be  deployed  and  consequently projects do suffer in both qualitative and quantitative measures. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Lack of Ownership – Project manager should take ownership of the project and the performance of the project team. It is ultimately the responsibility of the project manager to deliver the project on time and lack of ownership can have significant impact on the successful delivery of the project. 
                        </p>

                    <p>
                      A  lead  developer  can  provide  general  design  guidance  and  can  also  help  aid  the  planning  of  the  product development and can provide feedback to the marketing or sales teams. The lead developer can discuss the CEO managers to make sure that the development team and technologies are selected and are aligned with the business goals of the company(Sasdy, 2020). The lead Developer also help by research new technologies for the team, can help give technical direction for the team. As a lead developer  you  will  need  to  have  great  communication  skills,  outstanding  understanding  of  the  product,  understanding  the  business  problem  of  the  software(Hickey,  2019).  As  a  lead  developer  another one  of  your  main  goals  is  to  boost  the  skills  of  your  team  members,  this  starts  right  from  recruitment and continues to progress with new developers, set some best practices for development for coding, comments or documentation, reduce time needed for production launched by improving process(Bridger,  2014).  What  does  it  take  to  be  a  lead  developer  you  are  required  to  have  at  least  three  years  of  experience  in  technologies  as  visual  basic,  NET,  PHP,  C#/C++,  Microsoft  and  NET  framework development, you will also need to have a firm background in applications programming, you’ll need to have a  bachelor’s degree in computer science and a couple of years of proven success as a team leader (Half, 2017).

I liked that the communication style between each member was open, respectful, and relatively prompt, both via chat and via team meetings. At times it actually felt like I was chatting with colleagues, rather than fellow students, which was a great glimpse into what it might be like to work on a real life I.T project. I was also impressed that Amer stepped up to lead the meetings and help ensure everyone was on the same page.

                          <p class="bold">What could be improved</p>
                          <p>It  was  a  little  disconcerting  in  the  early  stages  in  that  there  seemed  to  be  a  lack  of  timely  communication, though any feelings of unease were put to rest after we held our first team meeting and  we  were  able  to  put  faces  to  names,  so  to  speak.  Earlier  agreement  on  the  methods  of  communication would have helped avoid this situation, particularly as I found myself having to use 2-3  different  methods  to  contact  people.  Some  group  members  also  had  technical  difficulties  using  Github which delayed profiles from assignment 1 being uploaded, though I imagine this will be less of an issue now that we have all had some experience in using the system. </p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that was surprising</p>
                          <p>Even though we were essentially six strangers, there was a surprisingly good level of compatibility in the group, and an interesting blend of personality types e.g. some extraverted and others introverted. I did not expect that the meetings would flow so smoothly, and despite being greatly separated by distance  and  time  differences,  it  felt  like  there  was  no  real  disadvantage  to  doing  the  assignment  together remotely as opposed to in person. I am pleased to say it has given me greater confidence in the idea of doing an entire bachelor’s degree online.</p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that you have learned about the group</p>
                          <p> This  experience  has  taught  me  that  communication  is  key  and  agreeing  to  one  or  two  preferred  methods  of  contact  early  in  the  project  helps  ensure  time  is  used  wisely  and  that  important information  does  not  get  missed.  I  have  also  learnt  it  is  always  safest  to  never  assume,  and  that  it  never  hurts  to  ask  something  twice  than  to  not  ask  at  all.  I  understand  that  our  schedules  are  all  entirely different, and some compromise on my part will always be needed to ensure everything gets done  in  the  required  time  frame,  but  that  this  will  help  ensure  a  successfully  completed  project,  as  well as utmost respect for my fellow team members.</p>
                          <p class="bold">How log of activity on GitHub reflects on group work?</p>
                          <p>We used  a  range  of  tools  for  communicating  and  contributing  our  work  and  ideas,  including  Teams  chat,  Canvas,  Discord,  and  email.  Therefore,  I  feel  the  log  of  activity  on  GitHub  alone  really  reflects  just  a  mere  portion  of  the  amount  of  work  we  had  all  put  in  to  getting  the  project  completed.  My  feeling is that GitHub would certainly be useful in work environments such as Software Development where each person would work individually and contribute their changes to a live work in progress. Our  work  style  however  was  collaborative  and  given  the  differences  in  levels  of  experience  and  knowledge  it  was  far  more  appropriate  for  us  to  also  use  other  tools  such  as  Chat  and  Discord.  
                            Combined, the history and trails of information in each of these tools overall capture our group work very well.</p>

                          <p class="bold">What went well</p>
                          <p>Deciding on the Project was much easier than expected, as we all agreed to pursue one of our team members ideal Project to help with the family business. Our group realised the genuineness and the passion he had to succeed. All members were very supportive of the idea and contributed well to bring it to light. Without a doubt, there is great potential in the future if it all goes well. </p>
                          <p class="bold">What could be improved</p>
                          <p>Timeframe - We can never underestimate the amount of time required to complete a Project as we might  be  faced  with  unforeseen  circumstances  and  therefore,  it  will  be  very  risky  for  the  group  to  speed up their performance and this can lead to other unnecessary situations. Allowing sufficient time to complete a Project is very wise and beneficial from every directions. My technical knowledge and understanding of the tools required to build apps/websites is lacking and not quite there yet as this is my first IT studies. It is an opener for me now to set goals and clear directions will help me acquire knowledge and understanding to progress further.</p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that was surprising</p>
                          <p>The  variety  of  skillsets  required  for  the  Project  that  differentiate  group  members  was  absolutely  overwhelming from my perspective. There was a lot involved, the information required from start to the end was overwhelming and it has given me the eagerness to make the most of the opportunity to keep up with my studies and continue with learning about developing apps i.e. the amount of different languages, coding, etc. </p>

                            The uniqueness of our group members remained the same since we teamed as a group. Willingness to work together to accomplished our goals successfully. Open and honest communication at all times during  meetings  and  other  form  of  discussions  and  interactions  was  encouraging  during  some  challenging times. Reaching out, offering support and help was amazing.

                          <p>I think our log of activities on GitHub for this assignment has improved a lot since our last one. Knowing that we have had a chance to practice and become more familiar with it functions has made it much easier to submit out log of activities to our repository with confidence.

                          <p>Once  the  group  was  established,  we  worked  together  well.  We  assigned  tasks,  set  targets,  and  scheduled  meetings  collaboratively.  If  someone  needed  help,  help  was  given.  Every  group  member  has contributed and offered to do work. Considering we did not know each other at all before forming this group, the whole process has run smoothly. I have enjoyed working with everyone in this group and all their work is greatly appreciated by me.</p>
                          <p class="bold">What could be improved</p>
                          <p>Initially we took a bit of time to get going and find our feet. This was overcome quite quickly though, once a rapport was established within the group.</p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that was surprising</p>
                          <p>What was surprising was that people from diverse backgrounds, life stages, experience and work schedules can come together and work harmoniously on a project. This doesn’t always happen in a workplace environment.</p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that you have learned about the group</p>
                          <p>Even if people are coming from different situations in life, if we have a common goal and motivation to achieve that goal, it can be quite easy for everybody to work together and help each other.</p>

                            Group repository on Github does reflect active group collaboration because all of us have pushed and pulled documentation using the repository. We also have used Canvas files, emailed and MS Teams to upload and exchange documentation.

                          <p>I think what went well as our group that we all contributed to the group assignment, we were able to get everything done before the due date. There were no arguments in the group which was a plus for our group. Everyone was assigned into doing something which was a really good idea. Everyone did what they were meant to do. </p>

                          <p>What I think that should improve next time is that we need to be more communicated with each other, so we know what everyone in the group knows what everyone is doing, and should be reminded what to do every few days or so and what other people are doing too. </p>

                          <p>Group came together in late September and by the time tasks were allocated, members were left to do most of the work within 7-10 days.

                          <p>It is almost inevitable that a group comes together for the completion of a project and there is bound to be a conflict or a difficult personality or two, not with our group. Throughout our time together I have not heard a single word with any negative connotations nor has there been any conflict. </p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that you have learned about the group</p>
                          <p>Our group has wonderful attributes such as cultural diversity, varying levels of age and educational backgrounds. Creating a collaborative environment which was conducive to creativity, the ease with which difficult messages were communicated, adaptations to different personalities where potential barriers became opportunities to know each member at a personal level, these are some of the key takeaways from my interactions with this amazing group of people. </p>
                          <p class="bold">How log of activity on GitHub reflects on group work</p>
                          <p>Log of activity on GitHub alone may not be an accurate reflection on the contribution of all members. I created GitHub group repository but my lack of knowledge about accessibility issues restricted some members in their attempts to pull/push documents in the early stages of our collaboration. More accurate reflection will be to consider our activities across all platforms we have utilised such as Canvas, MS Teams including meeting minutes and GitHub. </p>

                          <p>Group formation was relatively straight forward, and group dynamics were established very early on when members shared their experiences and backgrounds openly. We became aware that there was wealth of knowledge and expertise within our group which could be harnessed to successfully complete our team project. Selecting team leader was a very smooth process and there were no conflicting personalities or clashing egos. Once assessment requirements were discussed, individual and team tasks were identified, members picked task voluntarily. A very collaborative, cohesive environment which proved to be conducive towards achieving our shared objectives through effective teamwork.</p>
                          <p class="bold">What could be improved</p>
                          <p>Group plans  were  formalised  less  than 5  weeks to  the  date  of  submission.  Notwithstanding  the  extenuating circumstances  and  uncertainty  due  to  COVID  pandemic,  our  collaboration  could  have  been  better.  Tentative  communication,  uncertainty  in  terms  of  how  to  approach  the  project  and  constant overflow of information through announcements and discussion board activities made it a very  challenging  start  to  our  collaboration.  Earlier  group  formation  would  have  allowed  members  additional  time  to  be  more  thorough  with  their  work  and  allowed  others  to  review  and  suggest improvements. Missed deadlines did result in trepidations among members and some members had to work extremely hard than others to complete the project. </p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that was surprising</p>
                          <p>Despite a late start and challenges early on, our group has managed to perform  well and adhered to internal and external deadlines. This was made possible due to similar personality traits of the members. Cooperation, collaboration, consideration, and willingness to compromise for the sake of others were the key attributes of our group. Extremely pleasant working environment which has been very conducive to producing results in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
                          <p class="bold">At least one thing that you have learned about groups</p>
                          <p>Our group is very diverse in terms of cultural and social diversity. Diverse environment can be very vibrant and productive because people from different backgrounds bring their own problem-solving skills to the fore. Diversity can also pose a challenge in terms of communicating within a group where members have varying levels of education, vastly different work experiences and future plans vary a great deal as well. One of the key takeaways for us collectively as a group has been the ability to overcome potential communications barriers. Throughout group formation, task delegation, meetings and completion checks, our group’s ability to effectively communicate with each other and work towards collective objectives has been very successful. This bodes well for us individually and as a group because communication is the most sought-after skill in IT professionals worldwide.</p>
                          <p class="bold">How log of activity on GitHub reflects on group work</p>
                          <p>To ascertain our collective success on group/teamwork, our collaboration across all platforms needs to be taken into consideration. GitHub presented some challenges for us in the beginning in terms of pull/push requests, members having difficulty in running GitHub desktop application, having right access levels and collaboration invitations across the group. We overcame all those issues but for the sake of better time management and our successful collaboration, Our group has used Canvas Discussion forums, MS Teams, Meetings, RMIT emails and GitHub for sharing and exchanging ideas as well as uploading and updating documents. There is a trail of all these documents gradually and ultimately uploaded to our group repository. All these documents were updated to a final draft version which forms the core of our project report.</p>
